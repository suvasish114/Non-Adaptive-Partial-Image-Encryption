# Non Adaptive Partial Image Encryption

A chaos based symmetric key partial image encryption by `BRSNC 2022` undergraduates, under `Dr. Sukalyan Som`'s supervision. An original image is decomposed into 8 binary bitplanes, among which the significant bitplanes are non adaptively determined. The significant bitplanes are then encrypted with the key stream generated by a "pseudo random binary bit generator" (based on crossed coupled chaotic random bit generator) and then combined with the unencrypted ones to form the cipher image. 

Performence on technique is verified by test based on image statistics key sensitive and impermeability of cipher image.
